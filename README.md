# When does people start getting married?

While friends around me transit from college students complaining about their homework taskS to gorgeous brides with sophisticated make up, I start to think of this question, when do people start getting married. 

## Deliverable

So I did this project with public survey data, end up with dashboard with multiple filter where you can see the distribution of marriage age within each category with different attributes or social status â€“ race, employment status, education level, immigration status.. (https://public.tableau.com/profile/rene6521#!/vizhome/marriageAge_0/Dashboard)

One step further, I used this dashboard to track the marriage probability of friends in my boyfriend's network and build a draggable network heatmap with D3.js.
